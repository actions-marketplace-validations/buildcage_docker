# The matching itself is unit-tested (blocked-outcome.test.ts), and the action
# input -> container environment half is what test-e2e.yml's known_blocked_rules
# job covers. What this covers is the middle: a rule set on the running builder
# decides whether fail_on_blocked fails the step, and one that matches nothing
# does not excuse the rest.
#
# Two phases over the same two-host build, because the rules are read from the
# container's own environment and each phase therefore needs its own builder:
# naming both blocked hosts must let the step pass, naming one of them must not.
