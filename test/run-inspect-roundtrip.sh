# The audit-then-restrict round trip, which is what the inspect engine is for.
#
# Phase 1 runs a build under `audit`, asserts what audit is supposed to have
# recorded, and takes the `allowed_url_rules` the report generated from what it
# saw. Phase 2 restarts under `restrict` with exactly those rules, changing
# nothing, and runs a build that repeats every request plus a few the first
# build never made.
#
# Both halves matter. Rules that break the build they were learned from make
# the workflow useless; rules that permit everything make it pointless.
#
# Driven as one script rather than from the Makefile because the second phase's
# configuration is produced by the first, and the two must not be run apart.
